**NoSQL Challenge: UK Food Standards Database Analysis**
This repository contains my solution for the NoSQL Challenge, where I analyze the UK Food Standards Agency's hygiene ratings data to assist the Eat Safe, Love magazine in evaluating establishments across the United Kingdom. The analysis is completed using MongoDB, Python, and Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook.
